# Photoacoustic imaging – a novel hybrid bioimaging modality for early cancer diagnosis

## Name of Supervisor

## Introduction 

Advances in diagnostic technology have dramatically improved the
detection and staging of cancer. Current imaging techniques—such
as ultrasound, CT, and MRI—have limited ability to detect small
lesions, however. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel
technologies for early detection of incipient neoplasia. Nonionizing
hybrid photoacoustic imaging bridges the current gap with high
contrast and deep penetration. 

In photoacoustic imaging (PAI), a short-pulsed laser is used to irradiate the tissue and the
photoacoustic waves, excited via thermoelastic expansion, are measured by ultrasonic transducers at the tissue boundary. 

The key advantages of PAI include 
(1) good imaging depth, 
(2) no speckle artifacts, 
(5) use of non-ionizing radiation, 
(6) relatively inexpensive,
etc. 

## Objective 

In this work, we aim to develop these novel imaging technology
and their various biological (and clinical) applications, such as early
cancer diagnosis. 
In this particular project, we will explore the
application of Deep Learning (DL) to improve photoacoustic image
reconstruction methods to improve the image quality, remove artifacts etc.
